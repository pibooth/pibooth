Extend ``pibooth`` functionalities
----------------------------------

The ``pibooth`` application is built on the top of
`pluggy <https://pluggy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_
that gives users the ability to extend or modify its behavior.

What is a plugin?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A plugin is a set of functions (called ``hooks``) defined in a python module
and participating to the ``pibooth`` execution when they are invoked.

The list of available ``hooks`` are defined in the file
`hookspecs.py <https://github.com/pibooth/pibooth/blob/master/pibooth/plugins/hookspecs.py>`_.
A plugin implements a subset of those functions.

There are 2 families of hooks implemented in `pibooth`:
 * Pibooth state-independent hooks
 * State dependant hooks (see below)

Influencing states
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``pibooth`` application is built on the principle of states. Each state
is defined by a specific screen and possible actions available to the user.

The following states are defined:
 * ``wait``       : wait for starting a new capture sequence
 * ``choose``     : selection of the number of captures
 * ``chosen``     : confirm the number of captures
 * ``preview``    : show preview and countdown
 * ``capture``    : take a capture
 * ``processing`` : build the final picture
 * ``print``      : show preview and ask for printing
 * ``finish``     : thank before going back to wait state
 * ``failsafe``   : oops message when an exception occurs

    :align: center
    :alt: State sequence

There are four hooks defined for each state.

- ``state_<name>_enter``

  Invoked one time when the state is activating.

- ``state_<name>_do``

  Invoked in a loop until the state is switching to an other one.

- ``state_<name>_validate``

  Invoked in a loop, returns the name of the next state if all conditions
  are met (else return ``None``).

- ``state_<name>_exit``

  Invoked one time when the state is exiting.

.. note:: Hooks specification defines all arguments that can be used by the hook
          implementation, but there is no need to put them in the function
          signature if they are not used in the code.

Code skeleton
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A plugin is generally a Python module called ``pibooth_[...].py``. For a better
configuration management, it should have the constant ``__version__`` set to the
plugin version:

.. code-block:: python

    __version__ = "1.0.0"

The ``pibooth_configure`` hook permits to define some new configuration options.
At this step of the starting process, only the pre-loaded configuration is
available (application is not created yet).

.. code-block:: python

    @pibooth.hookimpl
    def pibooth_configure(cfg):
        cfg.add_option('CONTROLS', 'startup_led_pin', 29,
                       "Physical GPIO OUT pin to light a LED at pibooth startup")

The new objects, which should persist between states, can be created and attached
to the application instance in the ``pibooth_startup`` hook:

.. code-block:: python

    @pibooth.hookimpl
    def pibooth_startup(cfg, app):
        app.led_startup = LED("BOARD" + cfg.get('CONTROLS', 'startup_led_pin'))
