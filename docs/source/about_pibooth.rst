.. note:: Even if designed for a Raspberry Pi, this software may be installed on any Unix/Linux
          based OS (tested on Ubuntu 16 and Mac OSX 10.14.6).

Features
--------

* Interface available in Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Hungarian, Norwegian and Spanish (customizable)
* Capture from 1 to 4 photos and concatenate them in a final picture
* Support all cameras compatible with gPhoto2, OpenCV and Raspberry Pi
* Support for hardware buttons and lamps on Raspberry Pi GPIO
* Fully driven from hardware buttons / keyboard / mouse / touchscreen
* Auto-start at the Raspberry Pi startup
* Animate captures from the last sequence during idle time
* Store final pictures and the individual captures
* Printing final pictures using CUPS server (printing queue indication)
* Custom texts can be added on the final picture (customizable fonts, colors, alignments)
* Custom background(s) and overlay(s) can be added on the final picture
* All settings available in a configuration file (most common options in a graphical interface)

Requirements
------------

The requirements listed below are the ones used for the development of ``pibooth``, but
other configuration may work fine. **All hardware buttons, lights and printer are optional**,
the application can be entirely controlled using a keyboard, a mouse or a touchscreen.

.. warning:: Using a Pi Camera, the preview is visible only on a screen connected to the HDMI or
             DSI connectors (the preview is an overlay managed at GPU low level). It also means
             that ``pibooth`` can not be started throught SSH tuneling. Even with X11 forwarding
             enabled (``ssh -X ...``) the preview will not be visible.
